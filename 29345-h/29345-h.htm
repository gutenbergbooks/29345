<p>that before this interval of the South Branch under
black mountains, there was another interval, the
Upper at Plymouth, where we walked in spring beyond
the covered bridge; but that the first interval
of all was the old farm, our brook interval, so called
by the man we had it from in sale.</p>

<h2>CHRISTMAS TREES</h2>
<p>(<i>A Christmas Circular Letter</i>)</p>
</div>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>
<span class="dcap">The</span> city had withdrawn into itself</p>
<p class='cg'>
And left at last the country to the country;</p>
<p class='cg'>
When between whirls of snow not come to lie</p>
<p class='cg'>
And whirls of foliage not yet laid, there drove</p>
<p class='cg'>
A stranger to our yard, who looked the city,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Yet did in country fashion in that there</p>
<p class='cg'>
He sat and waited till he drew us out</p>
<p class='cg'>
A-buttoning coats to ask him who he was.</p>
<p class='cg'>
He proved to be the city come again</p>
<p class='cg'>
To look for something it had left behind</p>
<p class='cg'>
And could not do without and keep its Christmas.</p>
<p class='cg'>
He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees;</p>
<p class='cg'>
My woods&ndash;&ndash;the young fir balsams like a place</p>
<p class='cg'>
Where houses all are churches and have spires.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I hadn&#8217;t thought of them as Christmas Trees.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I doubt if I was tempted for a moment</p>
<p class='cg'>
To sell them off their feet to go in cars</p>
<p class='cg'>
And leave the slope behind the house all bare,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I&#8217;d hate to have them know it if I was.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Yet more I&#8217;d hate to hold my trees except</p>
<p class='cg'>
As others hold theirs or refuse for them,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Beyond the time of profitable growth,</p>
<p class='cg'>
The trial by market everything must come to.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I dallied so much with the thought of selling.</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
<p class='cg'>
Then whether from mistaken courtesy</p>
<p class='cg'>
And fear of seeming short of speech, or whether</p>
<p class='cg'>
From hope of hearing good of what was mine,</p>
<p class='cg'>
I said, &#8220;There aren&#8217;t enough to be worth while.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;I could soon tell how many they would cut,</p>
<p class='cg'>
You let me look them over.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;You could look.</p>
<p class='cg'>
But don&#8217;t expect I&#8217;m going to let you have them.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Pasture they spring in, some in clumps too close</p>
<p class='cg'>
That lop each other of boughs, but not a few</p>
<p class='cg'>
Quite solitary and having equal boughs</p>
<p class='cg'>
All round and round. The latter he nodded &#8220;Yes&#8221; to,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one,</p>
<p class='cg'>
With a buyer&#8217;s moderation, &#8220;That would do.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>
I thought so too, but wasn&#8217;t there to say so.</p>
<p class='cg'>
We climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And came down on the north.</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>He said, &#8220;A thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;A thousand Christmas trees!&ndash;&ndash;at what apiece?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
He felt some need of softening that to me:</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Then I was certain I had never meant</p>
<p class='cg'>
To let him have them. Never show surprise!</p>
<p class='cg'>
But thirty dollars seemed so small beside</p>
<p class='cg'>
The extent of pasture I should strip, three cents</p>
<p class='cg'>
(For that was all they figured out apiece),</p>
<p class='cg'>
Three cents so small beside the dollar friends</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
<p class='cg'>
I should be writing to within the hour</p>
<p class='cg'>
Would pay in cities for good trees like those,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Regular vestry-trees whole Sunday Schools</p>
<p class='cg'>
Could hang enough on to pick off enough.</p>
<p class='cg'>
A thousand Christmas trees I didn&#8217;t know I had!</p>
<p class='cg'>
Worth three cents more to give away than sell,</p>
<p class='cg'>
As may be shown by a simple calculation.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Too bad I couldn&#8217;t lay one in a letter.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I can&#8217;t help wishing I could send you one,</p>
<p class='cg'>
In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas.</p>

<span class="dcap">All</span> out of doors looked darkly in at him</p>
<p class='cg'>
Through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,</p>
<p class='cg'>
That gathers on the pane in empty rooms.</p>
<p class='cg'>
What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze</p>
<p class='cg'>
Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand.</p>
<p class='cg'>
What kept him from remembering what it was</p>
<p class='cg'>
That brought him to that creaking room was age.</p>
<p class='cg'>
He stood with barrels round him&ndash;&ndash;at a loss.</p>
<p class='cg'>
And having scared the cellar under him</p>
<p class='cg'>
In clomping there, he scared it once again</p>
<p class='cg'>
In clomping off;&ndash;&ndash;and scared the outer night,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar</p>
<p class='cg'>
Of trees and crack of branches, common things,</p>
<p class='cg'>
But nothing so like beating on a box.</p>
<p class='cg'>
A light he was to no one but himself</p>
<p class='cg'>
Where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,</p>
<p class='cg'>
A quiet light, and then not even that.</p>
<p class='cg'>
He consigned to the moon, such as she was,</p>
<p class='cg'>
So late-arising, to the broken moon</p>
<p class='cg'>
As better than the sun in any case</p>
<p class='cg'>
For such a charge, his snow upon the roof,</p>
<p class='cg'>
His icicles along the wall to keep;</p>
<p class='cg'>
And slept. The log that shifted with a jolt</p>
<p class='cg'>
Once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept.</p>
<p class='cg'>
One aged man&ndash;&ndash;one man&ndash;&ndash;can&#8217;t fill a house,</p>
<p class='cg'>
A farm, a countryside, or if he can,</p>
<p class='cg'>
It&#8217;s thus he does it of a winter night.</p>

&#8220;Where will I put this walnut bureau, lady?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Put it on top of something that&#8217;s on top</p>
<p class='cg'>
Of something else,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;Oh, put it where</p>
<p class='cg'>
You can to-night, and go. It&#8217;s almost dark;</p>
<p class='cg'>
You must be getting started back to town.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Another blackened face thrust in and looked</p>
<p class='cg'>
And smiled, and when she did not turn, spoke gently,</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;What are you seeing out the window, <i>lady</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Never was I beladied so before.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Would evidence of having been called lady</p>
<p class='cg'>
More than so many times make me a lady</p>
<p class='cg'>
In common law, I wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;But I ask,</p>
<p class='cg'>
What are you seeing out the window, lady?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;What I&#8217;ll be seeing more of in the years</p>
<p class='cg'>
To come as here I stand and go the round</p>
<p class='cg'>
Of many plates with towels many times.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;And what is that? You only put me off.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Rank weeds that love the water from the dish-pan</p>
<p class='cg'>
More than some women like the dish-pan, Joe;</p>
<p class='cg'>
A little stretch of mowing-field for you;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Not much of that until I come to woods</p>
<p class='cg'>
That end all. And it&#8217;s scarce enough to call</p>
<p class='cg'>
A view.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;And yet you think you like it, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re so concerned to know! You hope</p>
<p class='cg'>
I like it. Bang goes something big away</p>
<p class='cg'>
Off there upstairs. The very tread of men</p>
<p class='cg'>
As great as those is shattering to the frame</p>
<p class='cg'>
Of such a little house. Once left alone,</p>
<p class='cg'>
You and I, dear, will go with softer steps</p>
<p class='cg'>
Up and down stairs and through the rooms, and none</p>
<p class='cg'>
But sudden winds that snatch them from our hands</p>
<p class='cg'>
Will ever slam the doors.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;I think you see</p>
<p class='cg'>
More than you like to own to out that window.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;No; for besides the things I tell you of,</p>
<p class='cg'>
I only see the years. They come and go</p>
<p class='cg'>
In alternation with the weeds, the field,</p>
<p class='cg'>
The wood.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
<p class='cg_center'>&#8220;What kind of years?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Why, latter years&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Different from early years.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;I see them, too.</p>
<p class='cg'>
You didn&#8217;t count them?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;No, the further off</p>
<p class='cg'>
So ran together that I didn&#8217;t try to.</p>
<p class='cg'>
It can scarce be that they would be in number</p>
<p class='cg'>
We&#8217;d care to know, for we are not young now.</p>
<p class='cg'>
And bang goes something else away off there.</p>
<p class='cg'>
It sounds as if it were the men went down,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And every crash meant one less to return</p>
<p class='cg'>
To lighted city streets we, too, have known,</p>
<p class='cg'>
But now are giving up for country darkness.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Come from that window where you see too much for me,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And take a livelier view of things from here.</p>
<p class='cg'>
They&#8217;re going. Watch this husky swarming up</p>
<p class='cg'>
Over the wheel into the sky-high seat,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Lighting his pipe now, squinting down his nose</p>
<p class='cg'>
At the flame burning downward as he sucks it.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;See how it makes his nose-side bright, a proof</p>
<p class='cg'>
How dark it&#8217;s getting. Can you tell what time</p>
<p class='cg'>
It is by that? Or by the moon? The new moon!</p>
<p class='cg'>
What shoulder did I see her over? Neither.</p>
<p class='cg'>
A wire she is of silver, as new as we</p>
<p class='cg'>
To everything. Her light won&#8217;t last us long.</p>
<p class='cg'>
It&#8217;s something, though, to know we&#8217;re going to have her</p>
<p class='cg'>
Night after night and stronger every night</p>
<p class='cg'>
To see us through our first two weeks. But, Joe,</p>
<p class='cg'>
The stove! Before they go! Knock on the window;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Ask them to help you get it on its feet.</p>
<p class='cg'>
We stand here dreaming. Hurry! Call them back!&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;They&#8217;re not gone yet.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to have the stove,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Whatever else we want for. And a light.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Have we a piece of candle if the lamp</p>
<p class='cg'>
And oil are buried out of reach?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>Again</p>
<p class='cg'>
The house was full of tramping, and the dark,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Door-filling men burst in and seized the stove.</p>
<p class='cg'>
A cannon-mouth-like hole was in the wall,</p>
<p class='cg'>
To which they set it true by eye; and then</p>
<p class='cg'>
Came up the jointed stovepipe in their hands,</p>
<p class='cg'>
So much too light and airy for their strength</p>
<p class='cg'>
It almost seemed to come ballooning up,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Slipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling.</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;A fit!&#8221; said one, and banged a stovepipe shoulder.</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s good luck when you move in to begin</p>
<p class='cg'>
With good luck with your stovepipe. Never mind,</p>
<p class='cg'>
It&#8217;s not so bad in the country, settled down,</p>
<p class='cg'>
When people&#8217;re getting on in life. You&#8217;ll like it.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Joe said: &#8220;You big boys ought to find a farm,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And make good farmers, and leave other fellows</p>
<p class='cg'>
The city work to do. There&#8217;s not enough</p>
<p class='cg'>
For everybody as it is in there.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;God!&#8221; one said wildly, and, when no one spoke:</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Say that to Jimmy here. He needs a farm.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>
But Jimmy only made his jaw recede</p>
<p class='cg'>
Fool-like, and rolled his eyes as if to say</p>
<p class='cg'>
He saw himself a farmer. Then there was a French boy</p>
<p class='cg'>
Who said with seriousness that made them laugh,</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Ma friend, you ain&#8217;t know what it is you&#8217;re ask.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>
He doffed his cap and held it with both hands</p>
<p class='cg'>
Across his chest to make as &#8217;twere a bow:</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;We&#8217;re giving you our chances on de farm.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>
And then they all turned to with deafening boots</p>
<p class='cg'>
And put each other bodily out of the house.</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Goodby to them! We puzzle them. They think&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
<p class='cg'>
I don&#8217;t know what they think we see in what</p>
<p class='cg'>
They leave us to: that pasture slope that seems</p>
<p class='cg'>
The back some farm presents us; and your woods</p>
<p class='cg'>
To northward from your window at the sink,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Waiting to steal a step on us whenever</p>
<p class='cg'>
We drop our eyes or turn to other things,</p>
<p class='cg'>
As in the game &#8216;Ten-step&#8217; the children play.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Good boys they seemed, and let them love the city.</p>
<p class='cg'>
All they could say was &#8216;God!&#8217; when you proposed</p>
<p class='cg'>
Their coming out and making useful farmers.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Did they make something lonesome go through you?</p>
<p class='cg'>
It would take more than them to sicken you&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Us of our bargain. But they left us so</p>
<p class='cg'>
As to our fate, like fools past reasoning with.</p>
<p class='cg'>
They almost shook <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;It&#8217;s all so much</p>
<p class='cg'>
What we have always wanted, I confess</p>
<p class='cg'>
It&#8217;s seeming bad for a moment makes it seem</p>
<p class='cg'>
Even worse still, and so on down, down, down.</p>
<p class='cg'>
It&#8217;s nothing; it&#8217;s their leaving us at dusk.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I never bore it well when people went.</p>
<p class='cg'>
The first night after guests have gone, the house</p>
<p class='cg'>
Seems haunted or exposed. I always take</p>
<p class='cg'>
A personal interest in the locking up</p>
<p class='cg'>
At bedtime; but the strangeness soon wears off.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>
He fetched a dingy lantern from behind</p>
<p class='cg'>
A door. &#8220;There&#8217;s that we didn&#8217;t lose! And these!&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Some matches he unpocketed. &#8220;For food&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
The meals we&#8217;ve had no one can take from us.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I wish that everything on earth were just</p>
<p class='cg'>
As certain as the meals we&#8217;ve had. I wish</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>

The meals we haven&#8217;t had were, anyway.</p>
<p class='cg'>
What have you you know where to lay your hands on?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;The bread we bought in passing at the store.</p>
<p class='cg'>
There&#8217;s butter somewhere, too.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Let&#8217;s rend the bread.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I&#8217;ll light the fire for company for you;</p>
<p class='cg'>
You&#8217;ll not have any other company</p>
<p class='cg'>
Till Ed begins to get out on a Sunday</p>
<p class='cg'>
To look us over and give us his idea</p>
<p class='cg'>
Of what wants pruning, shingling, breaking up.</p>
<p class='cg'>
He&#8217;ll know what he would do if he were we,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And all at once. He&#8217;ll plan for us and plan</p>
<p class='cg'>
To help us, but he&#8217;ll take it out in planning.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Well, you can set the table with the loaf.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Let&#8217;s see you find your loaf. I&#8217;ll light the fire.</p>

<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;There again, Joe!</p>

<i>You&#8217;re tired.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;I&#8217;m drunk-nonsensical tired out;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Don&#8217;t mind a word I say. It&#8217;s a day&#8217;s work</p>
<p class='cg'>
To empty one house of all household goods</p>
<p class='cg'>
And fill another with &#8217;em fifteen miles away,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Although you do no more than dump them down.&#8221;</p>

<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Dumped down in paradise we are and happy.&#8221;</p>

<p class='cg'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s all so much what I have always wanted,</p>

I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s what you wanted, too.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t you like to know?&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know</p>

<p class='cg'>
You wanted it for me.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;A troubled conscience!</p>

<p class='cg'>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to find out what can&#8217;t be known.</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
But who first said the word to come?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;My dear,</p>
<p class='cg'>
It&#8217;s who first thought the thought. You&#8217;re searching, Joe,</p>
<p class='cg'>
For things that don&#8217;t exist; I mean beginnings.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Ends and beginnings&ndash;&ndash;there are no such things.</p>
<p class='cg'>
There are only middles.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span style='margin-left: 10.15625em;'>&#8220;What is this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;This life?</p>
<p class='cg'>
Our sitting here by lantern-light together</p>
<p class='cg'>
Amid the wreckage of a former home?</p>
<p class='cg'>
You won&#8217;t deny the lantern isn&#8217;t new.</p>
<p class='cg'>
The stove is not, and you are not to me,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Nor I to you.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Perhaps you never were?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;It would take me forever to recite</p>
<p class='cg'>
All that&#8217;s not new in where we find ourselves.</p>
<p class='cg'>
New is a word for fools in towns who think</p>
<p class='cg'>
Style upon style in dress and thought at last</p>
<p class='cg'>
Must get somewhere. I&#8217;ve heard you say as much.</p>
<p class='cg'>
No, this is no beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Then an end?&#8221;</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;End is a gloomy word.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Is it too late</p>
<p class='cg'>
To drag you out for just a good-night call</p>
<p class='cg'>
On the old peach trees on the knoll to grope</p>
<p class='cg'>
By starlight in the grass for a last peach</p>
<p class='cg'>
The neighbors may not have taken as their right</p>
<p class='cg'>
When the house wasn&#8217;t lived in? I&#8217;ve been looking:</p>
<p class='cg'>
I doubt if they have left us many grapes.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Before we set ourselves to right the house,</p>
<p class='cg'>
The first thing in the morning, out we go</p>
<p class='cg'>
To go the round of apple, cherry, peach,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Pine, alder, pasture, mowing, well, and brook.</p>
<p class='cg'>
All of a farm it is.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;I know this much:</p>
<p class='cg'>
I&#8217;m going to put you in your bed, if first</p>
<p class='cg'>
I have to make you build it. Come, the light.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
When there was no more lantern in the kitchen,</p>
<p class='cg'>
The fire got out through crannies in the stove</p>
<p class='cg'>
And danced in yellow wrigglers on the ceiling,</p>
<p class='cg'>
As much at home as if they&#8217;d always danced there.</p>

Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,</p>

He says that leaves are old and that for flowers</p>

Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten.</p>

<h2>BIRCHES</h2>
</div>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>
<span class="dcap">When</span> I see birches bend to left and right</p>
<p class='cg'>
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,</p>
<p class='cg'>
I like to think some boy&#8217;s been swinging them.</p>
<p class='cg'>
But swinging doesn&#8217;t bend them down to stay.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them</p>
<p class='cg'>
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning</p>
<p class='cg'>
After a rain. They click upon themselves</p>
<p class='cg'>
As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored</p>
<p class='cg'>
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Soon the sun&#8217;s warmth makes them shed crystal shells</p>
<p class='cg'>
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away</p>
<p class='cg'>
You&#8217;d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.</p>
<p class='cg'>
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed</p>
<p class='cg'>
So low for long, they never right themselves:</p>
<p class='cg'>
You may see their trunks arching in the woods</p>
<p class='cg'>
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground</p>
<p class='cg'>
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair</p>
<p class='cg'>
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.</p>
<p class='cg'>
But I was going to say when Truth broke in</p>
<p class='cg'>
With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm</p>
<p class='cg'>
(Now am I free to be poetical?)</p>
<p class='cg'>
I should prefer to have some boy bend them</p>
<p class='cg'>
As he went out and in to fetch the cows&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Whose only play was what he found himself,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Summer or winter, and could play alone.</p>
<p class='cg'>
One by one he subdued his father&#8217;s trees</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
<p class='cg'>
By riding them down over and over again</p>
<p class='cg'>
Until he took the stiffness out of them,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And not one but hung limp, not one was left</p>
<p class='cg'>
For him to conquer. He learned all there was</p>
<p class='cg'>
To learn about not launching out too soon</p>
<p class='cg'>
And so not carrying the tree away</p>
<p class='cg'>
Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise</p>
<p class='cg'>
To the top branches, climbing carefully</p>
<p class='cg'>
With the same pains you use to fill a cup</p>
<p class='cg'>
Up to the brim, and even above the brim.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.</p>
<p class='cg'>
So was I once myself a swinger of birches.</p>
<p class='cg'>
And so I dream of going back to be.</p>
<p class='cg'>
It&#8217;s when I&#8217;m weary of considerations,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And life is too much like a pathless wood</p>
<p class='cg'>
Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs</p>
<p class='cg'>
Broken across it, and one eye is weeping</p>
<p class='cg'>
From a twig&#8217;s having lashed across it open.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I&#8217;d like to get away from earth awhile</p>
<p class='cg'>
And then come back to it and begin over.</p>
<p class='cg'>
May no fate willfully misunderstand me</p>
<p class='cg'>
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away</p>
<p class='cg'>
Not to return. Earth&#8217;s the right place for love:</p>
<p class='cg'>
I don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s likely to go better.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I&#8217;d like to go by climbing a birch tree,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk</p>
<p class='cg'>
<i>Toward</i> heaven, till the tree could bear no more,</p>
<p class='cg'>
But dipped its top and set me down again.</p>
<p class='cg'>
That would be good both going and coming back.</p>
<p class='cg'>
One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.</p>

Let&#8217;s not care what we do with it to-night.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Divide it? No! But burn it as one pile</p>
<p class='cg'>
The way we piled it. And let&#8217;s be the talk</p>
<p class='cg'>
Of people brought to windows by a light</p>
<p class='cg'>
Thrown from somewhere against their wall-paper.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Rouse them all, both the free and not so free</p>
<p class='cg'>
With saying what they&#8217;d like to do to us</p>
<p class='cg'>
For what they&#8217;d better wait till we have done.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Let&#8217;s all but bring to life this old volcano,</p>
<p class='cg'>
If that is what the mountain ever was&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
And scare ourselves. Let wild fire loose we will....&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;And scare you too?&#8221; the children said together.</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t it scare me to have a fire</p>
<p class='cg'>
Begin in smudge with ropy smoke and know</p>
<p class='cg'>
That still, if I repent, I may recall it,</p>
<p class='cg'>
But in a moment not: a little spurt</p>
<p class='cg'>
Of burning fatness, and then nothing but</p>
<p class='cg'>
The fire itself can put it out, and that</p>
<p class='cg'>
By burning out, and before it burns out</p>
<p class='cg'>
It will have roared first and mixed sparks with stars,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And sweeping round it with a flaming sword,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Made the dim trees stand back in wider circle&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
<p class='cg'>
Done so much and I know not how much more</p>
<p class='cg'>
I mean it shall not do if I can bind it.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Well if it doesn&#8217;t with its draft bring on</p>
<p class='cg'>
A wind to blow in earnest from some quarter,</p>
<p class='cg'>
As once it did with me upon an April.</p>
<p class='cg'>
The breezes were so spent with winter blowing</p>
<p class='cg'>
They seemed to fail the bluebirds under them</p>
<p class='cg'>
Short of the perch their languid flight was toward;</p>
<p class='cg'>
And my flame made a pinnacle to heaven</p>
<p class='cg'>
As I walked once round it in possession.</p>
<p class='cg'>
But the wind out of doors&ndash;&ndash;you know the saying.</p>
<p class='cg'>
There came a gust. You used to think the trees</p>
<p class='cg'>
Made wind by fanning since you never knew</p>
<p class='cg'>
It blow but that you saw the trees in motion.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Something or someone watching made that gust.</p>
<p class='cg'>
It put the flame tip-down and dabbed the grass</p>
<p class='cg'>
Of over-winter with the least tip-touch</p>
<p class='cg'>
Your tongue gives salt or sugar in your hand.</p>
<p class='cg'>
The place it reached to blackened instantly.</p>
<p class='cg'>
The black was all there was by day-light,</p>
<p class='cg'>
That and the merest curl of cigarette smoke&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
And a flame slender as the hepaticas,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Blood-root, and violets so soon to be now.</p>
<p class='cg'>
But the black spread like black death on the ground,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And I think the sky darkened with a cloud</p>
<p class='cg'>
Like winter and evening coming on together.</p>
<p class='cg'>
There were enough things to be thought of then.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Where the field stretches toward the north</p>
<p class='cg'>
And setting sun to Hyla brook, I gave it</p>
<p class='cg'>
To flames without twice thinking, where it verges</p>
<p class='cg'>
Upon the road, to flames too, though in fear</p>
<p class='cg'>
They might find fuel there, in withered brake,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Grass its full length, old silver golden-rod,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And alder and grape vine entanglement,</p>
<p class='cg'>
To leap the dusty deadline. For my own</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
<p class='cg'>
I took what front there was beside. I knelt</p>
<p class='cg'>
And thrust hands in and held my face away.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Fight such a fire by rubbing not by beating.</p>
<p class='cg'>
A board is the best weapon if you have it.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I had my coat. And oh, I knew, I knew,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And said out loud, I couldn&#8217;t bide the smother</p>
<p class='cg'>
And heat so close in; but the thought of all</p>
<p class='cg'>
The woods and town on fire by me, and all</p>
<p class='cg'>
The town turned out to fight for me&ndash;&ndash;that held me.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I trusted the brook barrier, but feared</p>
<p class='cg'>
The road would fail; and on that side the fire</p>
<p class='cg'>
Died not without a noise of crackling wood&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Of something more than tinder-grass and weed&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
That brought me to my feet to hold it back</p>
<p class='cg'>
By leaning back myself, as if the reins</p>
<p class='cg'>
Were round my neck and I was at the plough.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I won! But I&#8217;m sure no one ever spread</p>
<p class='cg'>
Another color over a tenth the space</p>
<p class='cg'>
That I spread coal-black over in the time</p>
<p class='cg'>
It took me. Neighbors coming home from town</p>
<p class='cg'>
Couldn&#8217;t believe that so much black had come there</p>
<p class='cg'>
While they had backs turned, that it hadn&#8217;t been there</p>
<p class='cg'>
When they had passed an hour or so before</p>
<p class='cg'>
Going the other way and they not seen it.</p>
<p class='cg'>
They looked about for someone to have done it.</p>
<p class='cg'>
But there was no one. I was somewhere wondering</p>
<p class='cg'>
Where all my weariness had gone and why</p>
<p class='cg'>
I walked so light on air in heavy shoes</p>
<p class='cg'>
In spite of a scorched Fourth-of-July feeling.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Why wouldn&#8217;t I be scared remembering that?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;If it scares you, what will it do to us?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Scare you. But if you shrink from being scared,</p>
<p class='cg'>
What would you say to war if it should come?</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
<p class='cg'>
That&#8217;s what for reasons I should like to know&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
If you can comfort me by any answer.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Oh, but war&#8217;s not for children&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s for men.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Now we are digging almost down to China.</p>
<p class='cg'>
My dears, my dears, you thought that&ndash;&ndash;we all thought it.</p>
<p class='cg'>
So your mistake was ours. Haven&#8217;t you heard, though,</p>
<p class='cg'>
About the ships where war has found them out</p>
<p class='cg'>
At sea, about the towns where war has come</p>
<p class='cg'>
Through opening clouds at night with droning speed</p>
<p class='cg'>
Further o&#8217;erhead than all but stars and angels,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
And children in the ships and in the towns?</p>
<p class='cg'>
Haven&#8217;t you heard what we have lived to learn?</p>
<p class='cg'>
Nothing so new&ndash;&ndash;something we had forgotten:</p>
<p class='cg'>
<i>War is for everyone, for children too</i>.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I wasn&#8217;t going to tell you and I mustn&#8217;t.</p>
<p class='cg'>
The best way is to come up hill with me</p>
<p class='cg'>
And have our fire and laugh and be afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>Likes to tell how one spring</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
When she was a girl on the farm, she did</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>A childlike thing.</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
One day she asked her father</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>To give her a garden plot</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
To plant and tend and reap herself,</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>And he said, &#8220;Why not?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
In casting about for a corner</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>He thought of an idle bit</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
Of walled-off ground where a shop had stood,</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>And he said, &#8220;Just it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
And he said, &#8220;That ought to make you</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>An ideal one-girl farm,</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
And give you a chance to put some strength</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>On your slim-jim arm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
It was not enough of a garden,</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>Her father said, to plough;</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
So she had to work it all by hand,</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>But she don&#8217;t mind now.</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
<p class='cg'>
She wheeled the dung in the wheelbarrow</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>Along a stretch of road;</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
But she always ran away and left</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>Her not-nice load.</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
And hid from anyone passing.</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>And then she begged the seed.</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
She says she thinks she planted one</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>Of all things but weed.</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
A hill each of potatoes,</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>Radishes, lettuce, peas,</span></p>

<span class='in2'>And even fruit </span><a name='TC_4'></a><ins title="Added period">trees.</ins></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
And yes, she has long mistrusted</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>That a cider apple tree</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
In bearing there to-day is hers,</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>Or at least may be.</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Her crop was a miscellany</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>When all was said and done,</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
A little bit of everything,</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>A great deal of none.</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
<i>Now</i> when she sees in the village</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>How village things go,</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
Just when it seems to come in right,</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>She says, &#8220;<i>I</i> know!</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
<p class='cg'>
It&#8217;s as when I was a farmer&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>

<span class='in2'>Oh, never by way of advice!</span></p>

<h2>THE EXPOSED NEST</h2>

<span class="dcap">You</span> were forever finding some new play.</p>
<p class='cg'>
So when I saw you down on hands and knees</p>
<p class='cg'>
In the meadow, busy with the new-cut hay,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Trying, I thought, to set it up on end,</p>
<p class='cg'>
I went to show you how to make it stay,</p>
<p class='cg'>
If that was your idea, against the breeze,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And, if you asked me, even help pretend</p>
<p class='cg'>
To make it root again and grow afresh.</p>
<p class='cg'>
But &#8217;twas no make-believe with you to-day,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Nor was the grass itself your real concern,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Though I found your hand full of wilted fern,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Steel-bright June-grass, and blackening heads of clover.</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8217;Twas a nest full of young birds on the ground</p>
<p class='cg'>
The cutter-bar had just gone champing over</p>
<p class='cg'>
(Miraculously without tasting flesh)</p>
<p class='cg'>
And left defenseless to the heat and light.</p>
<p class='cg'>
You wanted to restore them to their right</p>
<p class='cg'>
Of something interposed between their sight</p>
<p class='cg'>
And too much world at once&ndash;&ndash;could means be found.</p>
<p class='cg'>
The way the nest-full every time we stirred</p>
<p class='cg'>
Stood up to us as to a mother-bird</p>
<p class='cg'>
Whose coming home has been too long deferred,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Made me ask would the mother-bird return</p>
<p class='cg'>
And care for them in such a change of scene</p>
<p class='cg'>
And might our meddling make her more afraid.</p>
<p class='cg'>
That was a thing we could not wait to learn.</p>
<p class='cg'>
We saw the risk we took in doing good,</p>
<p class='cg'>
But dared not spare to do the best we could</p>
<p class='cg'>
Though harm should come of it; so built the screen</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
<p class='cg'>
You had begun, and gave them back their shade.</p>
<p class='cg'>
All this to prove we cared. Why is there then</p>
<p class='cg'>
No more to tell? We turned to other things.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I haven&#8217;t any memory&ndash;&ndash;have you?&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Of ever coming to the place again</p>
<p class='cg'>
To see if the birds lived the first night through,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And so at last to learn to use their wings.</p>

And from there those that lifted eyes could count</p>
<p class='cg'>
Five mountain ranges one behind the other</p>
<p class='cg'>
Under the sunset far into Vermont.</p>
<p class='cg'>
And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,</p>

As it ran light, or had to bear a load.</p>
<p class='cg'>
And nothing happened: day was all but done.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Call it a day, I wish they might have said</p>

To please the boy by giving him the half hour</p>

That a boy counts so much when saved from work.</p>

His sister stood beside them in her apron</p>

To tell them &#8220;Supper.&#8221; At the word, the saw,</p>

As if to prove saws knew what supper meant,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Leaped out at the boy&#8217;s hand, or seemed to leap&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
He must have given the hand. However it was,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Neither refused the meeting. But the hand!</p>
<p class='cg'>
The boy&#8217;s first outcry was a rueful laugh,</p>
<p class='cg'>
As he swung toward them holding up the hand</p>
<p class='cg'>
Half in appeal, but half as if to keep</p>
<p class='cg'>
The life from spilling. Then the boy saw all&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Since he was old enough to know, big boy</p>
<p class='cg'>
Doing a man&#8217;s work, though a child at heart&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
He saw all spoiled. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him cut my hand off&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
The doctor, when he comes. Don&#8217;t let him, sister!&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>
So. But the hand was gone already.</p>
<p class='cg'>
The doctor put him in the dark of ether.</p>
<p class='cg'>
He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath.</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
<p class='cg'>
And then&ndash;&ndash;the watcher at his pulse took fright.</p>
<p class='cg'>
No one believed. They listened at his heart.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Little&ndash;&ndash;less&ndash;&ndash;nothing!&ndash;&ndash;and that ended it.</p>
<p class='cg'>
No more to build on there. And they, since they</p>

Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs.</p>

&#8217;Cross lots, &#8217;cross walls, &#8217;cross everything,</p>

Between the house and barn the gale</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>Got him by something he had on</span></p>

And blew him out on the icy crust</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>That cased the world, and he was gone!</span></p>

<p class='cg'>
Walls were all buried, trees were few:</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>He saw no stay unless he stove</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
A hole in somewhere with his heel.</p>

<p class='cg'>
And stamped and said things to himself,</p>

<span class='in2'>And sometimes something seemed to yield,</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
He gained no foothold, but pursued</p>

<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>

<span class='in2'>Like wings, revolving in the scene</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
Upon his longer axis, and</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>With no small dignity of mien.</span></p>

<p class='cg'>
Faster or slower as he chanced,</p>

<span class='in2'>Sitting or standing as he chose,</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
According as he feared to risk</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>His neck, or thought to spare his clothes,</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
He never let the lantern drop.</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>And some exclaimed who saw afar</span></p>

The figures he described with it,</p>

<span class='in2'>Or been made Master of the Grange.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
He reeled, he lurched, he bobbed, he checked;</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>He fell and made the lantern rattle</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
(But saved the light from going out.)</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>So half-way down he fought the battle</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Incredulous of his own bad luck.</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>And then becoming reconciled</span></p>

Sometimes as an authority</p>

<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Yankees are what they always were.</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>Don&#8217;t think Brown ever gave up hope</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
Of getting home again because</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>He couldn&#8217;t climb that slippery slope;</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Or even thought of standing there</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>Until the January thaw</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
Should take the polish off the crust.</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>He bowed with grace to natural law,</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
And then went round it on his feet,</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>After the manner of our stock;</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
Not much concerned for those to whom,</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>At that particular time o&#8217;clock,</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
It must have looked as if the course</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>He steered was really straight away</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
From that which he was headed for&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>Not much concerned for them, I say;</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
<p class='cg'>
No more so than became a man&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'><i>And</i> politician at odd seasons.</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
I&#8217;ve kept Brown standing in the cold</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>While I invested him with reasons;</span></p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
But now he snapped his eyes three times;</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>Then shook his lantern, saying, &#8220;Ile&#8217;s</span></p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8217;Bout out!&#8221; and took the long way home</p>
<p class='cg'>
<span class='in2'>By road, a matter of several miles.</span></p>

Better than if he had had me ride,</p>
<p class='cg'>
A man with a swinging bag for load</p>
<p class='cg'>
And half the bag wound round his hand.</p>
<p class='cg'>
We talked like barking above the din</p>

Of water we walked along beside.</p>
<p class='cg'>
And for my telling him where I&#8217;d been</p>

And where I lived in mountain land</p>
<p class='cg'>
To be coming home the way I was,</p>
<p class='cg'>
He told me a little about himself.</p>
<p class='cg'>
He came from higher up in the pass</p>

Where the grist of the new-beginning brooks</p>

Is blocks split off the mountain mass&ndash;&ndash;</p>

Ever to grind to soil for grass.</p>

(The way it is will do for moss.)</p>
<p class='cg'>
There he had built his stolen shack.</p>
<p class='cg'>
It had to be a stolen shack</p>
<p class='cg'>
Because of the fears of fire and loss</p>
<p class='cg'>
That trouble the sleep of lumber folk:</p>
<p class='cg'>
Visions of half the world burned black</p>
<p class='cg'>
And the sun shrunken yellow in smoke.</p>
<p class='cg'>
We know who when they come to town</p>
<p class='cg'>
Bring berries under the wagon seat,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Or a basket of eggs between their feet;</p>
<p class='cg'>
What this man brought in a cotton sack</p>
<p class='cg'>
Was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce.</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
<p class='cg'>
He showed me lumps of the scented stuff</p>
<p class='cg'>
Like uncut jewels, dull and rough.</p>
<p class='cg'>
It comes to market golden brown;</p>
<p class='cg'>
But turns to pink between the teeth.</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
I told him this is a pleasant life</p>
<p class='cg'>
To set your breast to the bark of trees</p>
<p class='cg'>
That all your days are dim beneath,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And reaching up with a little knife,</p>
<p class='cg'>
To loose the resin and take it down</p>
<p class='cg'>
And bring it to market when you please.</p>

Gulped snow, and then blew free again&ndash;&ndash;the Coles</p>
<p class='cg'>
Dressed, but dishevelled from some hours of sleep,</p>

Meserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore.</p>

Meserve was first to speak. He pointed backward</p>
<p class='cg'>
Over his shoulder with his pipe-stem, saying,</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;You can just see it glancing off the roof</p>
<p class='cg'>
Making a great scroll upward toward the sky,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Long enough for recording all our names on.&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
I think I&#8217;ll just call up my wife and tell her</p>
<p class='cg'>
I&#8217;m here&ndash;&ndash;so far&ndash;&ndash;and starting on again.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I&#8217;ll call her softly so that if she&#8217;s wise</p>

And gone to sleep, she needn&#8217;t wake to answer.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Three times he barely stirred the bell, then listened.</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Why, Lett, still up? Lett, I&#8217;m at Cole&#8217;s. I&#8217;m late.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I called you up to say Good-night from here</p>

Before I went to say Good-morning there.&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
I thought I would.&ndash;&ndash;I know, but, Lett&ndash;&ndash;I know&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
I could, but what&#8217;s the sense? The rest won&#8217;t be</p>
<p class='cg'>
So bad.&ndash;&ndash;Give me an hour for it.&ndash;&ndash;Ho, ho,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Three hours to here! But that was all up hill;</p>
<p class='cg'>
The rest is down.&ndash;&ndash;Why no, no, not a wallow:</p>
<p class='cg'>
They kept their heads and took their time to it</p>
<p class='cg'>
Like darlings, both of them. They&#8217;re in the barn.&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
My dear, I&#8217;m coming just the same. I didn&#8217;t</p>
<p class='cg'>
Call you to ask you to invite me home.&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>

He lingered for some word she wouldn&#8217;t say,</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>

Said it at last himself, &#8220;Good-night,&#8221; and then,</p>

Getting no answer, closed the telephone.</p>

The three stood in the lamplight round the table</p>

There on the table, ever since I came,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Trying to turn itself backward or forward,</p>
<p class='cg'>
I&#8217;ve had my eye on it to make out which;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>

It wants to see how you will take, if backward</p>
<p class='cg'>
It&#8217;s from regret for something you have passed</p>
<p class='cg'>
And failed to see the good of. Never mind,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Things must expect to come in front of us</p>
<p class='cg'>
A many times&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t say just how many&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
That varies with the things&ndash;&ndash;before we see them.</p>
<p class='cg'>
One of the lies would make it out that nothing</p>
<p class='cg'>
Ever presents itself before us twice.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Where would we be at last if that were so?</p>
<p class='cg'>
Our very life depends on everything&#8217;s</p>
<p class='cg'>
Recurring till we answer from within.</p>
<p class='cg'>
The thousandth time may prove the charm.&ndash;&ndash;That leaf!</p>
<p class='cg'>
It can&#8217;t turn either way. It needs the wind&#8217;s help.</p>
<p class='cg'>
But the wind didn&#8217;t move it if it moved.</p>
<p class='cg'>
It moved itself. The wind&#8217;s at naught in here.</p>
<p class='cg'>
It couldn&#8217;t stir so sensitively poised</p>
<p class='cg'>
A thing as that. It couldn&#8217;t reach the lamp</p>
<p class='cg'>
To get a puff of black smoke from the flame,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Or blow a rumple in the collie&#8217;s coat.</p>
<p class='cg'>
You make a little foursquare block of air,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Quiet and light and warm, in spite of all</p>
<p class='cg'>
The illimitable dark and cold and storm,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And by so doing give these three, lamp, dog,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Though for all anyone can tell, repose</p>
<p class='cg'>
May be the thing you haven&#8217;t, yet you give it.</p>
<p class='cg'>
So false it is that what we haven&#8217;t we can&#8217;t give;</p>
<p class='cg'>
So false, that what we always say is true.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I&#8217;ll have to turn the leaf if no one else will.</p>
<p class='cg'>
It won&#8217;t lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t want to hurry you, Meserve,</p>
<p class='cg'>
But if you&#8217;re going&ndash;&ndash;Say you&#8217;ll stay, you know?</p>
<p class='cg'>
But let me raise this curtain on a scene,</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
<p class='cg'>
And show you how it&#8217;s piling up against you.</p>
<p class='cg'>
You see the snow-white through the white of frost?</p>
<p class='cg'>
Ask Helen how far up the sash it&#8217;s climbed</p>
<p class='cg'>
Since last we read the gage.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;It looks as if</p>
<p class='cg'>
Some pallid thing had squashed its features flat</p>
<p class='cg'>
And its eyes shut with overeagerness</p>
<p class='cg'>
To see what people found so interesting</p>
<p class='cg'>
In one another, and had gone to sleep</p>
<p class='cg'>
Of its own stupid lack of understanding,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Or broken its white neck of mushroom stuff</p>
<p class='cg'>
Short off, and died against the window-pane.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Brother Meserve, take care, you&#8217;ll scare yourself</p>
<p class='cg'>
More than you will us with such nightmare talk.</p>
<p class='cg'>
It&#8217;s you it matters to, because it&#8217;s you</p>
<p class='cg'>
Who have to go out into it alone.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Let him talk, Helen, and perhaps he&#8217;ll stay.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Before you drop the curtain&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m reminded:</p>
<p class='cg'>
You recollect the boy who came out here</p>
<p class='cg'>
To breathe the air one winter&ndash;&ndash;had a room</p>
<p class='cg'>
Down at the Averys&#8217;? Well, one sunny morning</p>
<p class='cg'>
After a downy storm, he passed our place</p>
<p class='cg'>
And found me banking up the house with snow.</p>
<p class='cg'>
And I was burrowing in deep for warmth,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Piling it well above the window-sills.</p>
<p class='cg'>
The snow against the window caught his eye.</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8216;Hey, that&#8217;s a pretty thought&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;those were his words.</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8216;So you can think it&#8217;s six feet deep outside,</p>
<p class='cg'>
While you sit warm and read up balanced rations.</p>
<p class='cg'>
You can&#8217;t get too much winter in the winter.&#8217;</p>
<p class='cg'>
Those were his words. And he went home and all</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
<p class='cg'>
But banked the daylight out of Avery&#8217;s windows.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Now you and I would go to no such length.</p>
<p class='cg'>
At the same time you can&#8217;t deny it makes</p>
<p class='cg'>
It not a mite worse, sitting here, we three,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Playing our fancy, to have the snowline run</p>
<p class='cg'>
So high across the pane outside. There where</p>
<p class='cg'>
There is a sort of tunnel in the frost</p>
<p class='cg'>
More like a tunnel than a hole&ndash;&ndash;way down</p>
<p class='cg'>
At the far end of it you see a stir</p>
<p class='cg'>
And quiver like the frayed edge of the drift</p>
<p class='cg'>
Blown in the wind. I <i>like</i> that&ndash;&ndash;I like <i>that</i>.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Well, now I leave you, people.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Come, Meserve,</p>
<p class='cg'>
We thought you were deciding not to go&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
The ways you found to say the praise of comfort</p>
<p class='cg'>
And being where you are. You want to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll own it&#8217;s cold for such a fall of snow.</p>
<p class='cg'>
This house is frozen brittle, all except</p>
<p class='cg'>
This room you sit in. If you think the wind</p>
<p class='cg'>
Sounds further off, it&#8217;s not because it&#8217;s dying;</p>
<p class='cg'>
You&#8217;re further under in the snow&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s all&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
And feel it less. Hear the soft bombs of dust</p>
<p class='cg'>
It bursts against us at the chimney mouth,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And at the eaves. I like it from inside</p>
<p class='cg'>
More than I shall out in it. But the horses</p>
<p class='cg'>
Are rested and it&#8217;s time to say good-night,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And let you get to bed again. Good-night,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Sorry I had to break in on your sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Lucky for you you did. Lucky for you</p>
<p class='cg'>
You had us for a half-way station</p>
<p class='cg'>
To stop at. If you were the kind of man</p>
<p class='cg'>
Paid heed to women, you&#8217;d take my advice</p>
<p class='cg'>
And for your family&#8217;s sake stay where you are.</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
<p class='cg'>
But what good is my saying it over and over?</p>
<p class='cg'>
You&#8217;ve done more than you had a right to think</p>
<p class='cg'>
You could do&ndash;&ndash;<i>now</i>. You know the risk you take</p>
<p class='cg'>
In going on.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Our snow-storms as a rule</p>
<p class='cg'>
Aren&#8217;t looked on as man-killers, and although</p>
<p class='cg'>
I&#8217;d rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep</p>
<p class='cg'>
Under it all, his door sealed up and lost,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Than the man fighting it to keep above it,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Yet think of the small birds at roost and not</p>
<p class='cg'>
In nests. Shall I be counted less than they are?</p>
<p class='cg'>
Their bulk in water would be frozen rock</p>
<p class='cg'>
In no time out to-night. And yet to-morrow</p>
<p class='cg'>
They will come budding boughs from tree to tree</p>
<p class='cg'>
Flirting their wings and saying Chickadee,</p>
<p class='cg'>
As if not knowing what you meant by the word storm.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;But why when no one wants you to go on?</p>
<p class='cg'>
Your wife&ndash;&ndash;she doesn&#8217;t want you to. We don&#8217;t,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And you yourself don&#8217;t want to. Who else is there?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Save us from being cornered by a woman.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Well, there&#8217;s&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;She told Fred afterward that in</p>
<p class='cg'>
The pause right there, she thought the dreaded word</p>
<p class='cg'>
Was coming, &#8220;God.&#8221; But no, he only said</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;the storm. That says I must go on.</p>
<p class='cg'>
That wants me as a war might if it came.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Ask any man.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>He threw her that as something</p>
<p class='cg'>
To last her till he got outside the door.</p>
<p class='cg'>
He had Cole with him to the barn to see him off.</p>
<p class='cg'>
When Cole returned he found his wife still standing</p>
<p class='cg'>
Beside the table near the open book,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Not reading it.</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Well, what kind of a man</p>
<p class='cg'>
Do you call that?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;He had the gift</p>
<p class='cg'>
Of words, or is it tongues, I ought to say?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Was ever such a man for seeing likeness?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Or disregarding people&#8217;s civil questions&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
What? We&#8217;ve found out in one hour more about him</p>
<p class='cg'>
Than we had seeing him pass by in the road</p>
<p class='cg'>
A thousand times. If that&#8217;s the way he preaches!</p>
<p class='cg'>
You didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d keep him after all.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Oh, I&#8217;m not blaming you. He didn&#8217;t leave you</p>
<p class='cg'>
Much say in the matter, and I&#8217;m just as glad</p>
<p class='cg'>
We&#8217;re not in for a night of him. No sleep</p>
<p class='cg'>
If he had stayed. The least thing set him going.</p>
<p class='cg'>
It&#8217;s quiet as an empty church without him.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;But how much better off are we as it is?</p>
<p class='cg'>
We&#8217;ll have to sit here till we know he&#8217;s safe.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Yes, I suppose you&#8217;ll want to, but I shouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p class='cg'>
He knows what he can do, or he wouldn&#8217;t try.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Get into bed I say, and get some rest.</p>
<p class='cg'>
He won&#8217;t come back, and if he telephones,</p>
<p class='cg'>
It won&#8217;t be for an hour or two.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Well then.</p>
<p class='cg'>
We can&#8217;t be any help by sitting here</p>
<p class='cg'>
And living his fight through with him, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p class='cg'>
Cole had been telephoning in the dark.</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
<p class='cg'>
Mrs. Cole&#8217;s voice came from an inner room:</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Did she call you or you call her?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;She me.</p>
<p class='cg'>
You&#8217;d better dress: you won&#8217;t go back to bed.</p>
<p class='cg'>
We must have been asleep: it&#8217;s three and after.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Had she been ringing long? I&#8217;ll get my wrapper.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I want to speak to her.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;All she said was,</p>
<p class='cg'>
He hadn&#8217;t come and had he really started.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;She knew he had, poor thing, two hours ago.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;He had the shovel. He&#8217;ll have made a fight.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Why did I ever let him leave this house!&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t begin that. You did the best you could</p>
<p class='cg'>
To keep him&ndash;&ndash;though perhaps you didn&#8217;t quite</p>
<p class='cg'>
Conceal a wish to see him show the spunk</p>
<p class='cg'>
To disobey you. Much his wife&#8217;ll thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Fred, after all I said! You shan&#8217;t make out</p>
<p class='cg'>
That it was any way but what it was.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Did she let on by any word she said</p>
<p class='cg'>
She didn&#8217;t thank me?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;When I told her &#8216;Gone,&#8217;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8216;Well then,&#8217; she said, and &#8216;Well then&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;like a threat.</p>
<p class='cg'>
And then her voice came scraping slow: &#8216;Oh, you,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Why did you let him go&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Asked why we let him?</p>
<p class='cg'>
You let me there. I&#8217;ll ask her why she let him.</p>

She didn&#8217;t dare to speak when he was here.</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
<p class='cg'>
Their number&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;twenty-one? The thing won&#8217;t work.</p>

<p class='cg'>
The stubborn thing, the way it jars your arm!</p>

It&#8217;s theirs. She&#8217;s dropped it from her hand and gone.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Try speaking. Say &#8216;Hello&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Hello. Hello.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;What do you hear?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;I hear an empty room&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
You know&ndash;&ndash;it sounds that way. And yes, I hear&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
I think I hear a clock&ndash;&ndash;and windows rattling.</p>
<p class='cg'>
No step though. If she&#8217;s there she&#8217;s sitting down.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Shout, she may hear you.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Shouting is no good.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Keep speaking then.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Hello. Hello. Hello.</p>
<p class='cg'>
You don&#8217;t suppose&ndash;&ndash;? She wouldn&#8217;t go out doors?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m half afraid that&#8217;s just what she might do.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;And leave the children?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Wait and call again.</p>
<p class='cg'>
You can&#8217;t hear whether she has left the door</p>
<p class='cg'>
Wide open and the wind&#8217;s blown out the lamp</p>
<p class='cg'>
And the fire&#8217;s died and the room&#8217;s dark and cold?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;One of two things, either she&#8217;s gone to bed</p>

Or gone out doors.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;In which case both are lost.</p>

Do you know what she&#8217;s like? Have you ever met her?</p>

It&#8217;s strange she doesn&#8217;t want to speak to us.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>

&#8220;What do you say it is?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_center'>&#8220;A baby&#8217;s crying!</p>
<p class='cg'>
Frantic it sounds, though muffled and far off.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Its mother wouldn&#8217;t let it cry like that,</p>

Not if she&#8217;s there.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;What do you make of it?&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing possible to make,</p>
<p class='cg'>
That is, assuming&ndash;&ndash;that she has gone out.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Of course she hasn&#8217;t though.&#8221; They both sat down</p>
<p class='cg'>
Helpless. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing we can do till morning.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;Hold on.&#8221; The double bell began to chirp.</p>

<p class='cg'>
&#8220;Hello, Meserve. You&#8217;re there, then!&ndash;&ndash;And your <a name='TC_7'></a><ins title="Removed extra stanza break">wife?</ins></p>
<p class='cg'>
Good! Why I asked&ndash;&ndash;she didn&#8217;t seem to answer.</p>
<p class='cg'>
He says she went to let him in the barn.&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='cg'>
We&#8217;re glad. Oh, say no more about it, man.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Drop in and see us when you&#8217;re passing.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Well,</p>
<p class='cg'>
She has him then, though what she wants him for</p>
<p class='cg'>
I <i>don&#8217;t</i> see.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg_right'>&#8220;Possibly not for herself.</p>
<p class='cg'>
Maybe she only wants him for the children.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;The whole to-do seems to have been for nothing.</p>
<p class='cg'>
What spoiled our night was to him just his fun.</p>
<p class='cg'>
What did he come in for?&ndash;&ndash;To talk and visit?</p>
<p class='cg'>
Thought he&#8217;d just call to tell us it was snowing.</p>
<p class='cg'>
If he thinks he is going to make our house</p>
<p class='cg'>
A halfway coffee house &#8217;twixt town and nowhere&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d feel you&#8217;d been too much concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;You think you haven&#8217;t been concerned yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p class='cg'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='cg'>
&#8220;If you mean he was inconsiderate</p>
<p class='cg'>
To rout us out to think for him at midnight</p>
<p class='cg'>
And then take our advice no more than nothing,</p>
<p class='cg'>
Why, I agree with you. But let&#8217;s forgive him.</p>
<p class='cg'>
We&#8217;ve had a share in one night of his life.</p>
<p class='cg'>
What&#8217;ll you bet he ever calls again?&#8221;</p>

<h2><i>THE SOUND OF THE TREES</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="italicized">
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>
<i>I wonder about the trees.</i></p>
<p class='cg'>
Why do we wish to bear</p>
<p class='cg'>
Forever the noise of these</p>
<p class='cg'>
More than another noise</p>
<p class='cg'>
So close to our dwelling place?</p>
<p class='cg'>
We suffer them by the day</p>
<p class='cg'>
Till we lose all measure of pace,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And fixity in our joys,</p>
<p class='cg'>
And acquire a listening air.</p>
<p class='cg'>
They are that that talks of going</p>
<p class='cg'>
But never gets away;</p>
<p class='cg'>
And that talks no less for knowing,</p>
<p class='cg'>
As it grows wiser and older,</p>
<p class='cg'>
That now it means to stay.</p>
<p class='cg'>
My feet tug at the floor</p>
<p class='cg'>
And my head sways to my shoulder</p>
<p class='cg'>
Sometimes when I watch trees sway,</p>
<p class='cg'>
From the window or the door.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I shall set forth for somewhere,</p>
<p class='cg'>
I shall make the reckless choice</p>
<p class='cg'>
Some day when they are in voice</p>
<p class='cg'>
And tossing so as to scare</p>
<p class='cg'>
The white clouds over them on.</p>
<p class='cg'>
I shall have less to say,</p>
<p class='cg'>
<i>But I shall be gone.</i></p>
